Spring-boot
===========

								Monolithic architecture
								========================
1 : Monolithic Application?
--> Monolithic application has " single code base with mutiple module" and has a single deployable binary.
--> A monolithic application is built as a single unit.
--> module are dependent on each other
Example : real world example is " Airpplane".
	--> flight itSelf is a single unit but it can have mutiple module.
	--> moduel : 1 : cockpit
				 2 : jet Engine
				 3 : cargo bay
				 4 : crew cabin


2 : disadvantages of Monolithic architecture?
--> Even a small change would require you to test the entire application.
--> Complexity in handling the data
--> if one module goes down the entire application would crash
--> very difficult to adapt to new technologies.

								Microservice architecture
								========================
1 : what a Microservice architecture?
--> Microservice architecture is a collection of services [module] that are highly maintainable and testable.
--> serviceses are Lossely coupled								
--> services are indepently deployable.
--> module a  re indepently on each other.
Example : real world example is "train".
--> train module :
		1: Engine
		2 : Load carrier
		3 : crow compartment
		4 : goods carrier
		5 : wheel base
	

2 : disadvantages of Monolithic architecture?	
--> Microservice comes with a lots of complexity.[ one large application split into small services ]
--> Microservice are more expensive.
--> Microservice are difficult to test.[because it is dependent to other service]
--> Difficult to debug.[ beacuse of dependent services ]


							Setting up the environment for microservices
							============================================
1 : step to Setting up the environment for microservices
--> latest JDK
--> IDE [ Eclipse , intelliji]
--> Maven / Gradele : project management tool
--> Postman

		
3 : Advantages of Monolithic architecture?
--> Even a small change would not require you to test the entire application.
--> No Complexity in handling the data
--> if one module goes down the entire application would not crash
--> very easy to adapt to new technologies.
