										Garbage collections / collector
										===============================
										

GC : destroye the usless object ,
garbage collector is the part of Jvm

													1 : introduction
													===================
													

1 : what is mean by grabage in programming?
----------------------------------------
--> usless object are called garbage.
--> the object which are not using , west or usless such types of object are grabage.

2 : who is responsible for collect the grabage?
-----------------------------------------------
--> grabage collector is responsible for collect the grabage or usless object.
												
3 : what is garbage collection ?
------------------------------
--> garbage collector will collect the grabage or usless object and the process is called garbage collections.

4 : need of grabage collector?
-----------------------------
old language
----------
--> in old language : C++ programmer is responsible for create an object using new keyword.
	Student stud = new Student();
--> delete keyword is used to delete the object in the old language.
--> beacause of programmer negelating deleting the usless object memomry will full.application will be down we will get " out of memomry error " in old language.

java
----
--> in java programmer is responsible for creating the object.
--> in java usless object are destroye by grabage collector. 
--> GC is always running in the background.

--> the need of garbage collector to destroye usless object.
--> GC is always running in the background.
--> background executing threads are called as "Daemon Threads".
--> Garbage collector is Daemon threads beacause it is always running in the background.

5 : when we say that object is eligible fo garbage collector?
-------------------------------------------------------------
--> if the object does not conatin any refernce varaibale is eligible for GC.


												way to make an object eligible for garbage collector
												=====================================================
												

6 : how many way to make an object eligible for garbage collector?
------------------------------------------------------------------
--> they are four way are there :
	1 : Nullifying the refernce varaibale
	2 : reasign the refernce varaibale
	3 : object created inside a method
	4 : Island of isolation
	
	
7 : what is mean by Nullifying the refernce varaibale?
-----------------------------------------------------
	Student s1 = new Student();
	Student s2 = new Student();
--> in above no object is eligible for GC 
--> if we assign s1 object to null [ s1 = null; ] s1 is eligible for GC. 

3 : The methods for requesting JVM to garbage collector
=======================================================
	1 : System.gc()
	2 : Runtime class gc()
	
4 : finalization
================
